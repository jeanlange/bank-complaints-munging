      "description" : "Each week we send thousands of consumers' complaints about financial products and services to companies for response. Complaints are listed in the database after the company responds or after they’ve had the complaint for 15 calendar days, whichever comes first.<br><br>\r\n\r\nWe publish the consumer’s description of what happened if the consumer opts to share it and after taking steps to remove personal information. See our <a href=\"http://files.consumerfinance.gov/a/assets/201503_cfpb_Narrative-Scrubbing-Standard.pdf\">Scrubbing Standard</a> for more details<br><br>\r\n\r\nWe don’t verify all the facts alleged in these complaints, but we take steps to confirm a commercial relationship. We may remove complaints if they don’t meet all of the publication criteria. Data is generally refreshed nightly. Company level information should be considered in context of company size and/or market share.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.consumerfinance.gov/complaintdatabase/\">More about the Consumer Complaint Database</a> | <a href=\"http://www.consumerfinance.gov/complaint/data-use/\">How we use complaint data</a> | <a href=\"http://www.consumerfinance.gov/complaintdatabase/technical-documentation/\">Technical documentation</a>",

They ran a credit report through XXXX and told me they could n't continue with the loan process until I dealt with a delinquent Judgment in the amount of {$3300.00} that came up in my name from XX/XX/XXXX. As I 've never been to court, I found this to be odd. I contacted the small claims office at the XXXX County Court and asked about the Judgment. They said there was a Judgment against someone who shares my first and last name, but informed me that it had been paid in XX/XX/XXXX and provided me a record. I asked if they could verify that the Judgment was mine with a social security number or any other personal identification information. The clerk told me no - they did n't have that information, but I should contact the debt collecting agency assigned to the case number and they could verify if it was mine. I called the agency ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) and provided them my name, city of residence, and social security number. They informed me that there was a file that shares my first and last name in XXXX, Oregon, but that the social security number did n't match - meaning it was n't mine. Knowing all this information, I began to inform my credit union and the credit bureau. I explained the situation and was able to clear it with my credit union. XXXX provided a printout to me stating they \" obtain public records from local, state and federal courts through a third party vendor, LexisNexis '' and provided XXXX phone number to contact. I filed a dispute at XX/XX/XXXX through the XXXX website and again with the call center and provided them with the public record showing that the Judgment had been paid and attempted to speak with someone at LexisNexis through the number provided. They told me that the dispute process could take up to 30 days and to expect the results of the investigation by mail. I waited and received the results at XX/XX/XXXX. The packet sent, which was a credit report summary, contained 13 different errors - one of which was that the Judgment remained in my file ( now paid, but still there ). The cover letter said, \" We have verified that our Judgment and Liens records are accurate based upon your dispute related to Filing Number XXXX, after contacting the XXXX Circuit Court-XXXX. '' Except that their records were not accurate, as the Judgment was n't delinquent and had been paid, yet there was no mention of any update on this. I know the court does n't have any information that would verify the Judgment is mine ( as I mentioned earlier ) and could not have verified this. The cover letter also provided an email address and phone number to call with any further questions. I called the call center on XX/XX/XXXX and filed a second dispute to include corrections on the other 12 errors, but was told I would have to wait for the dispute process to conclude ( possibly taking another 30 days ). I said that was unacceptable, as the initial dispute was not satisfied. Why should I need to dispute a dispute and why should I trust that the results would be any different - they 've already made this mistake TWICE and when I inquired why they were n't using any personal information to verify the Judgment, they call center had no answers. I asked to speak to a manager. I have spoken to XXXX within the last week ( XX/XX/XXXX - XX/XX/XXXX ). Each tell me there is no one they can communicate with outside of filing a dispute and they ca n't connect me to anyone involved in the investigative/dispute process despite the fact that their process is n't appropriately verifying the Judgment using any personal identifying information. I informed each of the managers that contacting the court is not an appropriate way to verify that the judgment is mine and to stop. I provided them with 2 different debt collecting agencies, who are each, after providing a social security number, able to verify that the Judgment is n't mine. The debt collecting agency name and contact are attached and easily viewable in the information corresponding to the judgment both on the court documents and summary provided by LexisNexis. The managers were unwilling to make the call themselves and could only add the instructions to my dispute case. I have sent 6 different emails to the only email provided explaining that the court does n't have the ability to verify the Judgment is mine and include instructions on how to appropriately verify the Judgment - none have been responded to. Neither manager was able to connect me to anyone in the email department. It has now been over 40 days since my initial dispute and I have had to spend numerous hours making numerous phone calls investigating this on my own and have had to instruct the credit bureau, LexisNexis, on how to correctly verify the Judgment only to be told there 's nothing they can do but let a reinvestigation of an investigation conclude. The only 2 numbers and email contact provided can not answer any of my questions or provide any meaningful assistance and can not provide any other means of contact. This is unacceptable. In the meantime I 've filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau, filed a complaint with XXXX, who inform me that they have no record of a Judgment in my name and are unable to explain why LexisNexis does. Managers for LexisNexis have since stopped returning my calls.",

One source of the inaccurate data has been from XXXX XXXX failure to record my full home address even though it was directly reported. That failure to record accurately resulted in a three months delay in my receiving income based payment annual application in a timely fashion. \nThis situation caused my account to lapse and collect past due fees for which I should not have been penalized. \n\nSecond, XXXX XXXX/Navient has also caused further harm by submitting the wrong information regarding my eligibility for deferment/forbearance plan. By supplying misleading information regarding my eligibility for deferment/forbearance, XXXX XXXX has manipulated my account and this process has given the XXXX XXXX the ability to wrongly charge my account with late payment status. \n\nFor clarity/specifics, on XX/XX/XXXX, I contacted XXXX XXXX by phone to report my change of address. The XXXX XXXX agent who handled my call informed me that she would update my account data. However, XXXX XXXX claimed that I simply failed to properly report a change of address. On the contrary, I have found my certified letter to XXXX XXXX dated in XX/XX/XXXX of that transaction request. \n( copy attached ) It took XXXX XXXX three full months before the application form was actually delivered to my correct home address. ( There has been late fees added to my account as a result of that late transaction by XXXX XXXX. ) Those late fees were added in XX/XX/XXXX when the Navient system reported my account as being ninety days past due on my credit report. \n\nThe other major problem is that I have been on the Income Based Payment Plan since XX/XX/XXXX. My loan was consolidated with XXXX XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX. \nHowever, when I lost a full time job in XX/XX/XXXX, a XXXX XXXX agent informed me that I was eligible for a deferment plan. However, she was wrong, and as a result of that wrong information, when the deferment time expired on that plan, a payment was necessary to keep my account updated. Yet, my income was too low to pay it. \nIn other words, I should have simply remained on the income based payment plan. \nThere was no real need to change plans in the first place. \nMeanwhile, the \" ninety days past due '' has been reported by XXXX XXXX/Navient on my credit report. This has limited my credit score and impacted my ability to obtain credit. \nI have supporting documents to support my above claim. There are two separate attachments which clearly identified the negative situation on my account with Navient. \n\nConsequently, I make the request that Navient remove the late fees from my current credit report. \n\nXXXX XXXX",

The original paperwork was given to a complete   stranger not only compromises my privacy, it is a detriment to being able to resolve the matter within the allotted time frame. Furthermore, I attempted to resolve this matter and negotiate a payment plan however, by the time I received this I '' mailed '' paperwork the online option was unavailable. I suffer from  XXXX   ( docu mented ), my privacy is especially important, due to this matter my stress is elevated-Who in fact received my paperwork? Why did I not receive it that day? What does this unsaid stranger know about me?   I tried to resolved this matter with your client before it came to this ( I have photos of trying to pay the bill on line and the down payment was ambiguous-and I have photos of it changing, I tried for a larger payment to not avail ).     I made every attempt to pay the bill, after my after my spouse died my accounts needed to be changed to a solo account and this takes some time ; coupled with identity theft shortly after-not only is a strain but it takes quite a bit of time to change these things. I am not eluding my responsibility, I am sincerely trying to resolve the matter and made calls expressing my situation long before this : bottom line is I could not make payments from an account I have no access to. My children had to take this responsibility in interim because my inaccessibility to all the matters that needed to be accomplished, legal matters are time lengthy-especially after death.     Sincerely, ________________"

She then stated that they hold the over payment for 10 business days. I asked her why, and she simply said that is their policy. I asked her if I would receive interest on my money and she stated no. I believe that Citizens bank is deliberately delaying the posting of payment and the return of consumer 's money to make additional interest for the bank. If this is not illegal it should be, it does hurt the consumer and is not ethical. My amount of money lost is minimal but if they are doing this on thousands of car loans a month, then the additional interest earned for them could be staggering.
